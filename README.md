Down To Fork (DTF) is a program that allows you to download your favorite YouTube videos. 


## Motivation
My favorite social media platform of all time is YouTube. I could watch my favorite creators for hours on end. Sometimes there are videos I would like to download permanently. However, YouTube doesn’t give you that option.
